## Groupwork

This is our second large group project.  There are three large things to be aware of for group projects:

1. Git
2. Trello
3. Group Roles

### Git

Unlike homework in the past where you forked a Pursuit repo, then committed and pushed at the end, a group project must be more collaborative.

The master branch should be the most current version of the project.  Whenever you want to make a change to the project, you should create a new branch named after the change you will be making.  Make your changes in the branch, then make a PR against master.  Someone else from your team should review the PR, then merge it into the master branch.  Everyone else should then pull the master branch to have the most current version on their local machines.


### Trello

Each group member should have an account on [Trello](https://trello.com/) and the group should have a well maintained list of who is working on what task.  Without this, two people might try to edit the same file and create merge conflicts.

* Make a copy of [this Trello board for your team](https://trello.com/b/dYKNBTdL). Only make one copy and make sure every team member is added to it.

### Group Roles

The expectation is that everyone in a group is chiefly occupied with writing code.  In addition to that, the following roles are important for someone to have explicit ownership of:

|       Role        |                                                                                        Responsibilities                                                                                         |
| :---------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

|       UI/UX       |                                                                        Is responsible for the design and flow of the app                                                                        |
| PR Review Process |                                     Is responsible for ensuring that PRs into master are reviewed, and that all team members are reviewing each other's PRs                                     |
