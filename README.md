- Users can upload an image
- Users can view images uploaded by other users in their feed
- Users can select an uploaded image to see more information about it

Your app should have the functionality outlined below.  Feel free to add features, and make the UI whatever makes the most sense to your group.

### Login Screen

- An input for entering an email address
- A 'Sign In' button that logs the user in
- A 'Create Account" button that creates a new user

Loging in or creating an account should dismiss the login screen and display the feed

### Feed

- Display images uploaded by all users
- Have a search bar that can search by hashtags and display only the relevant images

### Profile

- Display the email address of the current user
- Display the profile image of the current user and allow them to upload a new image
- Include a "Logout" button that logs the user out and presents the login screen

### Upload image form

- The user should be able to add hashtags to their upload
- Include a "Post" button

## Bonus Feature ideas

- Leave an emoji response on an image
